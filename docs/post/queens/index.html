           <p>Here are all the strategies you need to beat <a href="https://www.playqueensgame.com/">that one queens puzzle</a> on LinkedIn.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a region, row, or column has one available square, there&rsquo;s a queen there.</li>
<li>If a region has only a few squares,
it&rsquo;s likely some squares around it cannot contain queens
without blocking the entire region.</li>
<li>Equivalently, if a region has only a few squares,
the superposition of every placement of a queen within that region will block some squares.</li>
<li>Some shapes, like L, Z, S, U, J, 1x2, 1x3 have spots around them where no queen can be.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s only one region in a row or column,
then that region cannot have queens outside that row or column.</li>
<li>If n regions are contained entirely within n rows or n columns,
there cannot be any queens in regions that partially overlap these columns.</li>
<li>If n rows or n columns are covered entirely by n regions,
those regions cannot have queens outside those rows or columns.</li>
<li>When all else fails, place a queen randomly and keep solving,
keeping count of how many queens you&rsquo;ve placed.
If you run into a contradiction, backtrack and place an X.
If you don&rsquo;t run into a contradiction, backtrack
and try another random placement.</li>
<li>When placing a queen randomly, go for regions, rows, or columns with 2 or 3 available spaces.
That way, a contradiction will result in placing a queen.</li>
<li>When placing a queen randomly, go for spots that seem like they eventually won&rsquo;t work,
so that you can backtrack and pace an x.
The goal isn&rsquo;t to dodge invalid solutions,
the goal is to eliminate every invalid solution until only the actual solution remains.</li>
<li>Puzzles may have multiple solutions :/</li>
</ol>
<p>In part two, I&rsquo;ll show how you can develop a similar set of rules for any logic puzzle.</p>
