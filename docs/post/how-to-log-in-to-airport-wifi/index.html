           <p>Have you ever tried to connect to a public Wi-Fi network, but can&rsquo;t get the Terms of Service page to show up?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to fix that!</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li>open <a href="http://neverssl.com">http://neverssl.com</a>. Your browser will redirect you to a captive portal.</li>
<li>Accept terms of service and continue to the internet.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="why-this-works">Why this works</h1>
<p>At home, when you try to load a web page, your device sends a request over Wi-Fi to your <em>router</em> which <em>routes</em> the request to another router and so on, until it gets to the <em>server</em> which <em>hosts</em> the webpage. The <em>server</em> then <em>serves</em> the webpage over the same chain of routers back to you.</p>
<p>When you first try to open a webpage at an airport, the airport&rsquo;s router checks to see if it has seen your computer before. If it hasn&rsquo;t, instead of sending your request to the right server, and sending back the server&rsquo;s response, the airport&rsquo;s router sends its own webpage.</p>
<p>This is where things get interesting.
You may be thinking to yourself, &ldquo;Wait, so any time I visit a webpage, any router along the chain could just replace the page with anything they want without me knowing?&rdquo;.
The answer to that used to be yes.
Fortunately, most sites these days use HTTPS. Encryption is complicated, but it gives a few guarantees that are important with respect to captive portals.
Your computer can verify if a website has been tampered with. Most web browsers now refuse to load a page which does not have the correct cryptographic signature.</p>
<p>So what if I want an airport router to be able to send me a different page than the one I requested?
Go to a website that doesn&rsquo;t have the protections HTTPS offers, such as <a href="http://neverssl.com">http://neverssl.com</a>.
Otherwise, be cautious when using a site without HTTPS - someone could be eavesdropping or modifying what you see!</p>
