           <p>Last Advent of Code I took to putting assert statements for every invariant in my code. Most of my time was spent debugging, not the first write or running code. Adding so many asserts provided a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assert statements are a compact form of documenting invariants, both expected and produced, making code easier to reason about.</li>
<li>Each assert serves as a concise unit test with exactly the necessary cases.</li>
<li>Most importantly, asserts catch logic bugs when code doesn&rsquo;t produce the intended results</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing about this has me thinking, there should be a tool to transform assert statements into testing. The tool would have another keyword &ldquo;expect&rdquo; in addition to &ldquo;assert&rdquo;, for preconditions. With both preconditions and postconditions, individual functions can be automatically verified with a prover or a fuzzer! The tool could also check that preconditions are met at each call site, without having to write and rewrite unit tests for each call site!</p>
