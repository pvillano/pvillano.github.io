      <description>When the final tower is completed, time will overflow.&#xD;This animation counts down to the Epochalypse by displaying the current Unix time as progress in solving a 31 level Tower of Hanoi.&#xA;Unix Time Unix time is the number of seconds which have passed since midnight UTC, January 1, 1970, the Unix epoch. Computers use Unix time internally to store when an event occurred as a single number. Unlike regular1 timestamps, Unix timestamps are never repeated or skipped.</description>

      <description>Last Advent of Code I took to putting assert statements for every invariant in my code. Most of my time was spent debugging, not the first write or running code. Adding so many asserts provided a number of benefits:&#xA;Assert statements are a compact form of documenting invariants, both expected and produced, making code easier to reason about. Each assert serves as a concise unit test with exactly the necessary cases.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to connect to a public Wi-Fi network, but can&amp;rsquo;t get the Terms of Service page to show up?&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to fix that!&#xA;Connect to the Wi-Fi network. open http://neverssl.com. Your browser will redirect you to a captive portal. Accept terms of service and continue to the internet. Why this works At home, when you try to load a web page, your device sends a request over Wi-Fi to your router which routes the request to another router and so on, until it gets to the server which hosts the webpage.</description>

      <title>requirements.txt Trick</title>

      <description>This is my favorite way to manage dependencies in a python project. Create a requirements.txt file with unpinned1 dependencies. The following script will generate a file requirements-frozen.txt with the specified packages and all their dependencies version pinned. Commit both files to version management. Add or remove packages from requirements.txt and use requirements-frozen.txt for reproducible development/production builds. To update all packages, re-run the script.&#xA;#!/bin/sh&#xD;docker run -v &amp;#34;$(pwd)&amp;#34;:/req -w /req python:3.</description>
