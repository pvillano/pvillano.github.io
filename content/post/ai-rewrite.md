Here at whatever giant tech company, we have nothing better to do. 
Our core product is essentially complete,
and we've achieved market saturation.
A/B testing has revealed 
that we can make our product much worse
before users attempt to cancel their subscriptions.
Unfortunately, the rollout of these changes must be gradual,
and it will be multiple quarters before our app is completely unusable.

In the meantime, we are trying to look busy by adopting AI.
We even built a data center.
The space, previously a home for endangered species,
now houses billions of dollars of GPUs,
spread across dozens of servers.
It is powerd by a tarrif-subsidized coal power plant,
the first coal power plant built in the US since 2013.
However, normal operations have been under capacity.
Without sufficient load on the generators,
coal has been piling up outside the power plant.
The massive pile threatens to literally bury our investment,
when it should be dissipating harmlessly into the atmosphere.

The responsibility of finding something for our idle GPUs to actually do
fell on my team. Our board wanted a project that sounded impressive,
without creating something they would actually have to suffer through using.

I could not come up with an idea on my own,
because I have lost all ability to be creative.
I would have liked to brainstorm with my colleagues,
but they were all laid off.

Instead, we (my agentic AIs and I) combined my former colleagues' Slack messages, Zoom recordings, commit messages, and emails into "souls" for agents who could brainstorm for me.
A crossover algorithm was then used to bring the population of agents up to 1024.

Each agent was instructed to come up with a unique idea 
for a project demonstrating our AI dominance.
Their ideas were then pitted against each other in debates, 
through an eleven round, 
single-elimination tournament.
The winner of each round was judged by a replica of myself, 
and for impartiality, 
an agent instructed to disagree with anything my replica said.
Ties were broken by simulated coin toss.
A generated video of one of the debates is viewable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

As you may have guessed,
the winning idea was to generate digits of pi,
a classic flex for supercomputers and datacenters.
Surprisingly,
"all records from Dec 2009 onwards 
[have been] calculated and verified on commodity x86 computers 
with commercially available parts." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_computation_of_pi#2009%E2%80%93present)
Our internal training data stops before 2010,
so it makes sense that none of the agents knew this.
I only learned this when trying to find out what record we would need to break.

The most recent record was completed in 110 days. Time I did not have. With only days left in the challenge,
I decided to reemploy all 1024 agents in order
to make the best pi generator ever.
In one of the biggest pair-programming sessions ever,
every agent was run on the same filesystem,
without checkpoints or commits slowing them down.
This was left to run over the weekend.

Unfortunately, things did not go well unattended.
The following is our (me and my agentic AI's) best guess
as to what happened.
There were no managers in the soul database,
making it was impossible for the agents to coordinate themselves.
Extremely high write contention on the readme file
burned a hole in the underlying drive.
The resulting fire spread throughout the datacenter,
and to the adjacent power plant.
Both were completely destroyed,
resulting in billions of dollars of insurance payouts,
four deaths,
and the cancellation of our coal contract.

The lives we lost cannot be replaced with robots, yet.
We will rebuild and rehire.

Our cloud storage had a silver lining.
We (my agentic AIs and I) forgot to disable off-site backups.
Spread across many files,
these backups contained several thousand corrupted copies of the beginning digits of pi, 
generated entirely by AI.
The most accurate example got 69 digits correct,
currently the largest recorded example for pi generated entirely by AI.

No portion was written by AI, even though that would have fit the theme. {{< /details>}}
